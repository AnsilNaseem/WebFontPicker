# Web Font Picker (WFP)

A bookmarklet that helps preview Google Web Fonts live on any website. 

## Usage

Copy all the code in [`bookmarklet.js`](bookmarklet.js) and add it to your browser bookmarks. Opening the bookmark on a site will load the picker in the top right corner.

## Known issues

For security, some sites block scripts from unapproved domains, so the picker will not work on those (Github is one of them).
